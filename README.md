**CoffeeBreakApp**
Project 1: Coffee Break is on it's way to becoming a hub of wonderful local, hip, work-friendly coffee spots recommended by the biggest coffee lovers, work-from-homers, students, and most importantly..YOU. Users will be able to find coffee shops (based on their preferences) and have the ability to add and share their own favorite spots to grab some caffeine. Or a place where coffee spot owners may post their spot and try to grow their coffee business.
